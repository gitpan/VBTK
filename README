VBTK version 0.01
=================

VBTK is a collection of modules which can be used to build a complex monitoring
system completely written in perl.  It's system monitoring abilities are, at 
the moment, mostly limited to unix servers.  But it also supports 
monitoring through SNMP, HTTP, SMTP, TCP, POP3, etc., and the framework is
easily expanded.  More modules will be added over time.  It provides a central
server with a simple web interface which shows statuses, history, monitoring
details, and graphs.

Note that the VB toolkit is just a group of modules.  You write the final
perl program which runs them yourself.  But don't let that deter you, everything
is defaulted and quite simple, so the final perl program is usually very simple.
Also, there are several examples and templates to copy from.

Note also that I wrote most of this during my commute, while sitting on public
transportation, so it's not my best work ever, but I think it's still useful.

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

Perl 5.6
libwww-perl
Algorithm::Diff
Date::Manip
Mail::POP3Client
Mail::Sendmail
Storable
SNMP

If you want graphs, you'll also want to install rrdtool. 
(See http://www.rrdtool.com/index.html)  I strongly recommend this!

The VBServer doesn't run too well running directly on Windows.  The little 
testing I've done has shown it to constantly lock up.  I'm not sure why.
However, it runs great under Cygwin on Windows, so I strongly suggest using
Cygwin if you want to run this on Windows.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install
   
INITIAL CONFIGURATION

The first step is to get the VBServer up and running.  They you can see how
it looks and add monitoring processes a little at a time.  Also, once it's
up and running, you will be able to view the VBTK POD documentation online,
which gives further details on setting up your monitoring system.

So first, pick a location to install the application files.  I recommend
/usr/vbtk.  Now run the install

Please report bugs to vbtoolkit@yahoo.com.  I can't promise I'll be responsive,
but send away...
